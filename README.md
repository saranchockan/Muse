# Deviations
1. Spotify API - We were able to call the endpoints (top artist, top albums) for spotify data but it was harder than expected to parse
through them. There were Swift asynchronous programming concepts (Publishers, Subscribers) we were not able to grasp. 
2. Ticketmaster API - We did not have enough to come up with a schema to store concert data from Ticketmaster API in Firebase. 
The reason we were not able to deliver on storing user/spotify/concert data is because we had a lot of time understanding Firebase,
Swift API calls, Spotify Authorization, and XCode setup (package dependancies, data scoping).
